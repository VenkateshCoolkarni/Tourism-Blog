			  Arguably the most popular tourist attraction at Gulbarga, this fort was built in the twelfth century by the Kakatiya king Raja Gulchand. This granite monument imposes a stunning faÃ§ade which exhibits a beautiful blend of Persian and Indian architecture. Renovated by the Bahmani rulers two hundred years later, the Fort was expanded to strike a formidable barrier to invaders. Boasting of 15 towers, the structure is sure to make you marvel at the glory of the rulers of yore. The Jama Masjid located inside warms the soul with its spires and columns. You can picnic with your loved ones inside the ruins of the fort too!
