			  To witness a unique confluence of religious diversity, visit the Khwaja Bande Nawaz Dargah. This is the tomb of the famous Sufi mystic Khwaja Bande Nawaz. Home to a vast library composed of more than ten thousand books of Urdu, Arabic and Persian languages, this mausoleum is one of the most visited sites of Gulbarga. The Persian, Indo-Saracenic and Arabic influences on the building are evident from the dome and towers that surround the tomb. Even today, the Darga stands as a testament to the unity of various religions of the region. People believe that all wishes come true to earnest devotees who step foot in the mausoleum, regardless of religion. The neem tree built on the grave of the saintâ€™s daughter is said to have healing powers too.
